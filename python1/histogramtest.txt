This is a test file for the histogram-builder.
I can use this file to see whether my word-length-measuring histogram is working.
For the test to succeed, I'll have to have a decent amount of copy in this file.
Testing is important, though, so typing this stuff is worth it!
Yep, totally worth it.
Just like learning Python!
